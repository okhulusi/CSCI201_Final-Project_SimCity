This is a placeholder for the GUI folder.  In this folder there will be:
- The MainWindow class which will create an instance of the main JFrame and hold the rest of the panels
- The ControlPanel class which will have a tabbed structure containing three tabs, 1)CurrentPerson 2)CurrentBuilding, 
  and 3)NewPerson.
	- The Abstract CurrentBuilding class from which BuildingPanels will inherit and add building specific information.  This
   	  includes such things as a menu for the Restaurants or Stocks for the the Markets. Will use a CardLayout to manage
   	  all the unique building panels
	- The NewPerson panel which will inherit from JPanel and contain multiple fields such as Name, Money, Occupation, etc.
	- The CurrentPerson panel which will inherit from JPanel and display information such as money, current occupation
	  current nourishment, current active role, etc.
- The WorldView panel which will inherit from JPanel and contain a bunch of JButtons with 2DTextures to indicate the
  building
- The building view which will display the "inside" of the selected building.  Will use card layout to manage each
  unique building gui.
